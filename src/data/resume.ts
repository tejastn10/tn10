						"Led a cross-service member-unification migration consolidating three legacy member tables (paid, free, college) and 35+ downstream tables across 5 microservices into a single UUID-keyed accounts + members model. Designed a 7-phase rollout — NestJS-wrapper porting over the legacy Express app, dual-write, historical backfill of 5M+ records, GrowthBook-gated percentage cutover, legacy archival — and personally monitored the production DB for ~3 weeks post-cutover before disabling dual-write.",
						"Recovered a production outage where ECS tasks across services were dying from Postgres connection exhaustion on a shared primary; routed reads to existing-but-unused replicas overnight, shifting ~60–70% of read traffic and bringing p50 reads to 2–5 ms / p95 to 15–26 ms across major services. Extended the same replica pattern to Redis.",
						"Introduced GrowthBook to the engineering org as the unified feature-flag and experimentation platform; first in the org to adopt it at controller level — gating API rollouts (legacy → v2 cutovers, dual-write toggles, percentage-based read migration) directly inside NestJS request handlers. Pattern is now the standard across the platform.",
						"Designed and shipped a Lambda-based OTP delivery system with isolated senders per channel (WhatsApp via WABA, SMS via gateway) and per environment, including setting up a WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) for global OTP-over-WhatsApp. System-side error rate is 0% in production; overall end-to-end delivery success is 97%, with residual failures attributable entirely to upstream provider/gateway.",
						"Architected a Docker-based Lambda scaffold repository as the org-wide standard for containerized serverless functions; serves as the deployment base for all production Lambdas (OTP senders, file processors, scheduled jobs, and more), each containerized, versioned, and deployed via ECR — with Node.js and Python templates and local SQS/API Gateway emulation for developer testing.",
						"Re-architected the free-member app flow to eliminate a data-exposure risk in the registration API response: split a single endpoint into a frictionless public challenge-registration flow and an OTP-gated, rate-limited dashboard-login flow. Praised by the Product head and founders; directly enabled personalized journeys for repeat-challenge members by surfacing a clean returning-member signal.",
						"Overhauled the authentication layer across the platform and unified registration for all frontends (free and paid) into a single source of truth, replacing separate sign-up paths and eliminating duplicate account creation.",
						"Partnered with Marketing to RCA and rebuild the source-attribution pipeline for free-member registrations and reactivation flows, restoring attribution for previously-untracked returning-user and reactivation events across web, mobile-app, and Truecaller surfaces.",
						"Implemented a Redis-backed rate-limiting layer across all major APIs, securing previously open endpoints that were serving multiple consumers without any throttling.",
						"Spearheaded a production-grade NestJS service template adopted as the standard backend starter across the org; built a centralized file service for uploads/downloads across all microservices, removing duplicated S3 client code and tightening secure file handling.",
						"Centralized GitHub Actions workflows (lint, format, unit tests) into an org-level shared-workflows folder, enforcing consistent CI standards across all major repositories without duplicated pipeline config.",
						"Set up a robust development environment for all microservices, enabling teams to deploy any branch to the dev environment via GitHub Actions, reducing feature validation turnaround time.",
						"Established standardized naming conventions across AWS resources, bringing consistency and clarity to cloud infrastructure management.",
						"Initiated a new Link service in Go, laying the architectural foundation before ownership was transitioned to another team.",

Also built a rule-based brand safety validation system using json-rules-engine that ran in real-time during editing, enforcing workspace-specific brand guidelines on all creatives.",
						"Designed and implemented a scalable version history system on AWS S3 + Lambda using Google's Brotli compression for storage efficiency; configured S3 lifecycle policies to automatically expire outdated code archives, significantly reducing long-term storage costs.",
						"Led the effort to identify and fix 800+ system vulnerabilities, successfully achieving SOC2 compliance and greatly enhancing the security posture of the platform.",
						"Authored a custom GitHub Action for CI/CD deployment of Docker-based Lambdas to specific aliases/environments with automatic IAM role and permission enforcement.",
						"Migrated 65+ AWS Lambda functions from Node.js 14 → 18 → 20, updating all associated npm packages and dependencies to align with the latest runtime requirements.",
						"Automated the image export process via Puppeteer-in-Lambda with BullMQ queues providing real-time status updates and reliable retry handling for all export operations. Added a dedicated recovery mechanism for failed/stuck projects in the legacy v1 editor, consolidating all export operations into a single scheduled Lambda.",
						"Set up comprehensive monitoring for cost and infrastructure usage across AWS services, integrating alerts with Amazon SNS and Slack to proactively manage budget and resource consumption.",
						"Contributed to Rocketium's core video editor (similar to Adobe After Effects): precise timeline manipulation, keyframe movements, and layer snapping for scalable video production.",
